<p id="here">Jordan’s 1996–97 season is one for the history books. In Game 5 of The Finals, MJ put on a legendary performance, scoring 38 points, grabbing seven rebounds and handing out five assists while suffering a 103-degree temperature against the Utah Jazz. MJ would ultimately lead his team to yet another title.

Similar to MJ’s enduring drive, the technology and construction of the Air Jordan XII helped solidify it as one of the most durable Air Jordans of all time. And like Michael’s own style, the design of the shoe communicated a bold and striking elegance.</p>

<p>Inspired by a classic poster graphic from the ad campaign of the original Air Jordan 12, this all-new look released in 2016 features a luxe black leather upper with accents in grey and metallic gold. The clean version will go down as one of the best colorways for the twelfth Air Jordan ever. This listing is for Grade School sizing.</p>

<p>The classic Air Jordan 12 features a White leather upper with Black textured overlays, inner liner, heel and outsole. Speaking of the outsole, it features a Black and Yellow pattern on its carbon fiber reminiscent of NYC taxi cabs. Red accents can be found on the Jumpman branding on its heel and toe, while having Gold upper eyelets for a nice luxurious touch.</p>

<p>Re-igniting the trend set ablaze by many silhouettes from 2014, Jordan Brand is showing its love for Gym Red with a completely tonal take on the Air Jordan 12. With many silhouettes releasing in a heap of earth tones, the upcoming release is a refreshing addition to the holiday season, ushering in luxe materials that don the all red scheme. A sultry nubuck accompanies a reptilian-esque mudguard while metal hardware is added to complete the overall premium aesthetic, and although the all-red look may be a figment of past trends, it has always been well received. Retailing for $190 USD, the Air Jordan 12 “Gym Red” will be available online and at select retailers on November 24th.</p>
